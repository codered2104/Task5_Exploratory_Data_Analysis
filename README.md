## 🔍 Summary of Findings

- **Survival Rate**: Around 38% of passengers survived.
- **Gender**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Class**: 1st class passengers had better chances of survival.
- **Fare**: Higher fare often correlated with higher survival.
- **Age**: Children had a slightly better survival rate, but survival varied widely by age.
